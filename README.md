# AI Sentiment Analyzer (CLI)

A beginner-friendly **Python command-line application** that analyzes the sentiment of user-input text and classifies it as **Positive**, **Negative**, or **Neutral** using Natural Language Processing (NLP).

This project uses the **TextBlob** library, which internally relies on pre-trained sentiment analysis models.
